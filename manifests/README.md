# Ops files

You can apply changes to either your UAA configuration or your CF deployment manifest.

The underlying folders contain production-ready operator files and examples.

* [`ops-files/uaa`](uaa/) contains operator files to modify the default UAA configuration
* [`ops-files/cf`](cf/) contains operator files to modify the default Cloud Foundry deployment manifest
